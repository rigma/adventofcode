# Advent of Code Participation

This repository contains my participation to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge by @topaz.

You can find my solutions to each day in a subdirectory of a participation year (eg. you cand find my solutions for `2019` challenge into this directory).
Also, you may find solution in various languages: those challenges are for fun and to try some new things (eg. it's not meant to be useful for a production application).

### Copyleft

Yes, you may take this source code if you find some solution useful.
